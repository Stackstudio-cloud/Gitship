## Summary
The GitShip project has been significantly enhanced with 12 commits worth of improvements, including:

### Major Features Added:
1. **GitHub OAuth Integration** - Complete dual authentication system
2. **Repository Browser** - Interactive GitHub repository selection
3. **Enhanced Project Creation** - Auto-detection and validation
4. **Real-time Build System** - WebSocket streaming with live logs

### Technical Improvements:
- Database schema updates for GitHub integration

3. Deploy to production environment

## Files Modified:
