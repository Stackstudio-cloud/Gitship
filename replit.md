# replit.md

## Overview

GitShip is a revolutionary, open-source deployment platform with flame-powered speed and intelligence, built as a comprehensive full-stack web application that redefines how developers ship code. The platform enables users to connect GitHub repositories through dual authentication (Replit Auth + GitHub OAuth) and automatically build and deploy static sites with real-time monitoring. The application uses a modern monorepo structure with separate client and server directories, implementing a git-driven workflow with atomic deployments and professional flame-themed UI.
